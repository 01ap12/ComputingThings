---Git Bash Cheat Sheet---

ls = Lists all files/folders.
cd = Moves you into a specified folder.
cd - = Moves you back a folder.

Anything in "" is what you type.
Anything inside [ ] you replace with what is needed, you don't need the [ ] to be around the data.

--To find bash--

Windows key then search for "bash". It is the multi-coloured icon.


--Creating a repo--

1) "ls" and "cd" into the desired folder.
2) "github clone [link]" The [link] is found from your repo. Click on the green clone/download button and copy the link. You have to right-click and paste.
3) Log in to github on the prompt. (this may also happen later don't worry if it doesn't happen now)
4) The repo will be copied into the foler.

--Updating a repo / uploading your work--

1) "ls" and "cd" into the desired folder.
2) "git add [file name]" This adds the files to be ready for upload. If adding a whole folder then replace [filename] with [--all].
3) "git commit -m [reason for upload/changes made]" This again prepares the files and adds a reason for the upload, the reason must be in " ".
4) "git push origin master" This uploads the files to your github, updating your repo.

--Pulling / Downloading from github--

1) "ls" and "cd" into the desired folder.
2) "git pull" This will pull / download the files from your github onto your computer.
3) When pulling if the window fills with blue text asking for a merge reason, just close the terminal and then start it up again, this will fix it. (I think)
